        Archaeoindris fontoynontii is a gorilla-sized extinct giant lemur,
        the largest primate known from Madagascar. This sloth lemur was related
        to the extinct Palaeopropithecus and became extinct around 350 BCE. It was
        first described by Herbert F. Standing in 1909 based on subfossil jaw
        fragments, although a complete skull was later found. Only six bones from
        the lower skeleton have been located. The skeleton was massive and the
        arms were longer than the legs, but no hand or foot bones are known.
        Size estimates range as high as 244.1 kilograms (538.1 pounds),
        but regression analyses predict a mass of 160 kg (350 lb).

    <p> Misattributions and limited remains have resulted in differing opinions
        about how this lemur moved. Its skeleton suggests it was a climber
        that also travelled on the ground. Its diet was mostly leaves, and
        its former habitat, a mix of woodlands and savanna, is now mainly
        grassland. When humans arrived on Madagascar, it was still extant
        but vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss. (Full article...)
